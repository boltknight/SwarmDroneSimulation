Generate a full Java desktop application using JavaFX 21 and Maven for a project called "SwarmDrone Simulation System".

Requirements:
1. *Backend*: Use the provided domain model (DroneSwarm, Drone, Target, Coordinates, Mission, etc.). Implement core logic including:
   - initializeFromTransactions(List<Transaction>)
   - executeSwarmOperation()
   - calculateKillProbability
   - simulateMissionOutcome()

2. *Frontend*: Use JavaFX to create a clean dashboard UI:
   - A "Run Simulation" button.
   - A table showing all targets with ID, type, priority, and kill probability.
   - A label showing the cumulative kill probability after simulation.

3. *Integration*:
   - Backend should be called directly from frontend with no network/API.
   - Structure code using com.example.swarm package.
   - Place all source files under src/main/java.

4. *Build System*:
   - Use Maven with OpenJFX dependencies.
   - Add javafx-maven-plugin to support mvn javafx:run.

5. *Deliverables*:
   - Full code: frontend, backend, pom.xml.
   - Sample Transaction data hardcoded.
   - Instructions to build and run from VS Code terminal.

Output all code files using markdown code blocks. No explanation.
